# Time Management
A collection of techniques for making the most effiecient use of one's time


## Pomodoro
The Pomodoro technique helps you structure your working time. You work in a focused way for 25 minutes (one pomodoro) and then you have a 5-minute break. Then again a pomodoro and again a break. After you few iterations you may have a longer (10-15 min.) break.

Benefits:
* You become more productive because you can much more easily stay focused for 25 minutes. Working longer than that without a break tends to diminish your concentration, leading to a non-productive use of your time.
* By getting away from the thing you are working on for 5 minutes, you distance yourself from it (during the break). This helps you look at it from a different point of view and often, while you are resting, you may find better ways of doing what you are doing.
* After every 25 minutes you have a chance to get up, walk around, stretch, relax. And stop looking at the computer. This has very positive health benefits.
